This involved formatting the data to match the expected input for the library being used. I then had to tune the graph so that the nodes were nicely visible and applied styling using CSS to match the theme of our project. The biggest challenge was creating the hexagons for the theme and ensuring that the nodes in the graph stayed within the border. Outside of development, I participated in code reviews and design discussions.'],

I taught the team how you to read through the React Material UI API and how to implement the premade components in the application.
